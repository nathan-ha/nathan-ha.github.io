				<!-- Overview -->
				<p>Here, I will talk about my own spin on a game genre called bullet hell. Here is an <a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZu2O_JQ4vs">example</a>. This is a video of one of the
					most iconic bullet hell games out there, Touhou. You didn't come to see someone else's game though,
					right? You're here to see mine!</p>

				<strong>Software Used</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>AVR Library</strong> - Used to interface directly with the ATMega microcontroller bare
						metal, completely bypassing the Arduino library. Super useful when you want absolute low-level
						control over the controller. You can control basically everything, ranging from the pin
						registers to the timers and interrupts.</li>
					<li><strong>Platformio</strong> - Tool used for building and flashing C code onto the ATMega.</li>
				</ul>
				<strong>Cool Hardware Used</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Atmega328p (on the Arduino)</strong> - The microcontroller that ran the game. Yes, it is
						<em>technically</em> an Arduino. The reason I am specifiying <em>ATMega</em> is because none of
						the luxuries of the Arduino library were used here. Everything was coded purely from the AVR
						library. Basically, from scratch.</em></li>
					<li><strong>TFT Display (128x128)</strong> - The main screen for the game. Another fun one to
						program when you had no external libraries. Essentially, the biggest challenge was figuring out
						how to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface">SPI</a>, and
						digging through the datasheet to learn how to send bits as SPI commands. One of the greatest
						joys of this project was finally being able to draw pixels of any color, to any location on the
						screen.</li>
					<li><strong>Passive Buzzer</strong> - Plays all of the music for the game. I found this one really
						interesting because it sounds <em>exactly</em> like those old arcade game sound effects. To
						program this one, I essentially had to configure the timer on the ATMega to pulse the pin at
						specific frequencies in order to mimic a sound frequency. Also, it was surprisingly fun to write
						the music itself.</li>
					<li><strong>IR remote and receiver.</strong> - Remote that I primarily used for
						pausing/restarting/menu. Probably the most problematic hardware component of this project. This
						remote uses the NEC transmission protocol, which is a very common protocol. Surprisingly, the
						hardest part came when the IR remote would just not receive anything for seemingly no reason.
						After <em>much, much</em> debugging, as well as trial and error, I found that it had to do with
						the fact that my code was using interrupts to read the signals. Every some amount of
						microseconds, the microcontroller would use an interrupt service routine (ISR) to pause the
						currently running process, and read the signal on the IR receiver. This is all good and fine,
						until you consider the fact that the entire game uses a timerISR in order to synchronize the
						events of the entire game, as well as all the components. As it turns out, the timerISR has a
						higher priority than the interrupt used for decoding NEC signals (in my case, at least). Since
						the timerISR was always running, the NEC decoding <em>almost never</em> triggered at the right
						time, causing the signal to get corrputed. To fix this issue, I modified timerISR so that it
						wouldn't hog all the resources, and voila! It finally worked!</li>
					<li><strong>16x2 LCD Display</strong> - Calculator-looking display that I used to display text
						messages. Honestly, not my favorite piece of hardware since it glitches out so often, but it has
						its uses.</li>
					<li><strong>Joystick</strong> - Main controller for my game. Simple, but very reliable piece of
						hardware.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Here's a diagram of everything. Sorry about the lack of color-coding the wires.</p>
