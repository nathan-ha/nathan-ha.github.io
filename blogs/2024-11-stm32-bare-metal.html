										<p>
											This page mainly serves to document any progress I make with the STM board that I bought.
											My goal is to learn how to do low-level register programming without the use of the IDE or the
											HAL. While this wouldn't be my first time doing register programming, this would be my first time
											doing everything from scratch (especially ARM-Cortex).

											At this point, I managed to set up my build environment and managed to flash a very 
											simple blinking code onto the board. This part took a surprisingly long time to do,
											as I have been trying to do this on and off for a few weeks now. I bought this ST board
											because I believe that I have gotten far enough with my Atmel AVR board. ARM, while it
											looks a little more complicated, seems more interesting to me.
											<div class="spacer"></div>
											At first, I tried using Keil/ARM Studio, but after much toil, I realized they literally did not support
											the chip I was using (STM32F303RE). After that, I decided to give up on IDEs. I do have the STM32 Cube IDE,
											which works, but I really do not like it, so I avoid it if I can. It is useful for generation boilerplate code
											like the linker script, though.
											<div class="spacer"></div>
											In the end, I stuch with the good ol Makefile to build and flash my stuff. I am using the 
											ARM GCC compiler, and I flash the code using ST-LINK. Much of the necessary code
											for programming the registers was taken from the <a href="https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/cmsis-device-f3">CMSIS repository by STM</a>.
											It contains header filesâ€”defining all the registers so that I don't have to.
											<div class="spacer"></div>
											I actually did all that pretty quickly, but for some reason, nothing was working. 
											In turns out, there was also just a lot of boilerplate set up that needed to be done.
											Things like defining my own syscalls, handlers and set up functions	were things that I did
											not think I'd need. I do want to say that I needed to use the STM Cube IDE
											because it auto-generated a linker script. Also, since I did not set up debugging yet,
											I might have to use the IDE if I want to debug (for now).

                                            I consolidated all this stuff into this repository: <strong><a href="https://github.com/nathan-ha/stm32-bare-metal"> https://github.com/nathan-ha/stm32-bare-metal</a></strong>.
